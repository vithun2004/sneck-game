To run the Python code for the Snake game, you'll need to follow these steps:

Install Python: If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you can download it from the official Python website and follow the installation instructions.

Install Pygame library: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Pygame library:

pip install pygame
Create a new Python file: Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) and paste the provided Python code into a new file.
      
Save the file: Save the file with a .py extension, for example, snake_game.py.

Run the Python file: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file, and run the following command:
